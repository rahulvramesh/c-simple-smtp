```c
    struct sockaddr_in address;
    int addrlen = sizeof(address);
    char buffer[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE] = {0};
```

struct sockaddr_in address;: This line declares a variable named address of type struct sockaddr_in. This structure is commonly used in network programming with IPv4 addresses. It contains fields such as sin_family (the address family, typically AF_INET for IPv4), sin_port (the port number), and sin_addr (the IP address). In this case, it's used to store information about the address to which the server socket will be bound.

int addrlen = sizeof(address);: This line initializes an integer variable addrlen with the size of the address structure. The sizeof() operator returns the size of its operand in bytes. This line is often used in socket programming to specify the size of the address structure when calling functions like accept().

char buffer[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE] = {0};: This line declares a character array named buffer with a maximum size of MAX_BUFFER_SIZE. It initializes all elements of the array to zero. This buffer is typically used for receiving data from the network socket. In the context of an SMTP server, it might be used to store incoming email messages or SMTP commands. Initializing the buffer with zeros ensures that it starts with a clean slate, which can be useful for string manipulation functions and avoiding garbage data.

```c
    if ((server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == 0) {
    }
```

socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0): This function call creates a new socket. The socket() function takes three arguments:

- AF_INET: This specifies the address family, in this case, IPv4.

- SOCK_STREAM: This specifies the socket type, in this case, a stream socket, which provides a reliable, sequenced, and unduplicated flow of data.

- 0: This is the protocol parameter. When set to 0, the system chooses the appropriate protocol based on the chosen address family and socket type (in this case, it chooses TCP for SOCK_STREAM).

server_fd = socket(...) assigns the file descriptor returned by socket() to the variable server_fd. The file descriptor (server_fd) is an integer that represents the socket in subsequent operations.

(server_fd = socket(...)) == 0: This part of the code checks if the socket() call was successful. If the call is successful, socket() returns a non-zero value, which is the file descriptor of the socket. If it fails, it returns -1, indicating an error. However, in this case, the comparison is against 0, which is a common mistake. The correct comparison should be against -1. So, the code should ideally be if ((server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == -1).

```c
if (fork() == 0) {
    // Child process: Handle client request
    // Send A Welcome Message
    send(*client_fd, hello, strlen(hello), 0);
    // Close the client socket
    close(*client_fd);
    // Exit the child process
    exit(0);
}
```

fork(): The fork() system call creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. After a successful call to fork(), two processes are created: the parent process (which continues execution from the point of the fork() call) and the child process (which starts execution from the same point as the parent, but with a new process ID).

fork() == 0: This condition checks if the current process is the child process. In the child process, fork() returns 0.
